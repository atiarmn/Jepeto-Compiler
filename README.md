# Jepeto Compiler

In this project, we implemented Jepeto language compiler using java from scratch. This language has almost all of the features of widely used programming languages; features such as computational, logical and comparative operators, function and function calls, flow control, scopes and an extra feature named **Anonymous Function**.

Different modules are included in this compiler as same as an ordinary compiler:

* AST
* Code Generator
* Name Analyzer
* Type Checker
* Visitor
* Grammar processor

Tools such as Java, ANTLR, and Jasmin were used in different parts of the project from checking the grammar to generating bytecodes.
